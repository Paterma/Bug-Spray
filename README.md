# Bug-Spray

## Our Task

For our first project, we are to use our newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. With our team, we will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

## Our Learning Objectives

We will be employer-ready if we are able to:

* Speak technically about a features we implemented in our project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for our project
